# Hello staff 👋!
### New or old, everyone is expected to follow these to the best of their ability. If you slip up we will give you multiple chances so you learn from your mistakes. 

Here are some rules that you are supposed to follow ↓

 𝟭. Respect. Shouldn't be to hard to follow. Respect everyone equally.

 2.Follow [📜╏rules](https://discord.com/channels/639477525927690240/898041835002400768/898233552334897204) as well as these. You are still a member inside this community so you are not immune.

 3. Don't be bias towards people. Falls under respect at the end of the day.

 4. Be polite. When talking in chats we allow you to have fun and have a laugh with everyone. But still be polite 😀 .

 5. If someone asks you a question, be sure to answer it. This could be in a second, minute or even an hour. Just give a response. And if you don't know an answer to the question kindly say you don't know.

 6. If you don't know the answer to a ticket, don't answer/ chat in the channel unless you are giving an update on something you have had confirmation on. 

 7. Common sense. Self explanatory.

 8. Don't abuse your power, will get automatically demoted if caught doing this. 

 9. Inform other staff members if you find any problems/ unsure of a problem or punishment. We all make mistakes if you make one, it's all good, apologise and undo the punishment (if it's a ban contact a staff member with ban perms.) Use team work!

 10. Punishment logs, all staff are required to post proof ( [🧰╏proof](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/949604552779390976/968414011198685234/Screenshot_20220426-130124_Discord.png) ). If you don't you will get warnings which may result in a demotion.
